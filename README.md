# structures_and_algorithms

Did you ever wonder:
* "why isn't there a list type that automatically adjusts its sorting strategy according to the data I put in it"
* "This is the 3rd time I need to re-invent a "proximity sorted-array" that gives me the index of the item closest to the value I'm looking for"
* "Why is there no caching for this data structure?!"
* "Does no one else care for higher accuracy in these matrix operations?!"
* "My HashMap is really great if you just give it the charset it's meant to operate on"
* "How is *that* thing not in the standard library?"

Well, I did too. Maybe our minds are quantum-entangled or something.

Anyway, I did nothing with it, just kept on re-inventing the same niche wheels.

Whenever I'll come up with another non-standard standard-esque functionality idea I'll dump the code here! (Unless I forget, or don't feel like it.)

Don't try to talk me out of it! (You're welcome to submit ideas.)
